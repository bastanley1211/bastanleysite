            My journey into web and software engineering and design began back
            in the mid-2000's when I could only customize on my favorite
            childhood sites, and then my blog by knowing some code; and, by
            learning how to interact with web-builders. When the whim hit me, I
            would often build a site (HTML/CSS) and try and publish it for free
            somewhere since I was too young to have that kind of money üòÇ.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had an awakening in my mid-twenties after wandering around after
            my bachelor's degree in Asian Studies... on a whim and tip, I
            wandered on to Codecademy's website and started working through
            their HTML course material. It hit me on a New Year's Eve, "Why
            haven't I been doing this for the past ten years?"
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel most at peace when I can create or build things. I have
            always been driven by challenge, and am exhilarated when I am able
            to put all my focus into solving a problem. I enjoy when I can be a
            part of a create and collaborative team. I have realized that
            development can give me these desires
